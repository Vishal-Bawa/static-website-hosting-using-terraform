Terraform AWS S3 Static Website Hosting

Project Description:
In this project, I developed a streamlined infrastructure for hosting a static website using Terraform and Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the automated provisioning and deployment of a web hosting solution for static websites.

Key Components and Features:
Terraform Infrastructure as Code (IaC):
I utilized Terraform, an IaC tool, to define and provision the AWS resources required for my static website hosting solution. This allows for version-controlled, repeatable infrastructure deployments.

AWS S3 Bucket:
I created an S3 bucket to store and serve the static website files. This bucket is configured for website hosting, allowing for easy content delivery.

Content Upload and Management:
I provided instructions and scripts for uploading and managing my website content within the S3 bucket.
